additional instructions for each problem.

Ch. 2,  Programming Problems 2, pg. 94
Implement the algorithm maxArray, discussed in Section 2.4.3, as a C++ function.
What other recursive definitions of maxArray can you describe?
Section 2.4.3 Finding the Largest Value in a Sorted or Unsorted Array (pg. 72 - 73)

Name the program maxarray.cpp. Make sure the following requirements are met. 

* Program must compile and run.
* maxArray function must be a recursive template function.
* Add a main function to test the maxArray function so that you have a complete program.
* Test the maxArray function on two arrays of different types.
* Remember to upload all files before submitting.
